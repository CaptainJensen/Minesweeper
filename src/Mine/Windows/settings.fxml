  ~    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  ~
  ~    1. Definitions.
  ~
  ~       "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
  ~       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  ~
  ~       "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
  ~       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  ~
  ~       "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
  ~       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
  ~       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
  ~       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
  ~       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  ~       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
  ~       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  ~
  ~       "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
  ~       exercising permissions granted by this License.
  ~
  ~       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
  ~       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
  ~       source, and configuration files.
  ~
  ~       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
  ~       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
  ~       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
  ~       and conversions to other media types.
  ~
  ~       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  ~       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  ~       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
  ~       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  ~
  ~       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  ~       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  ~       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  ~       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  ~       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  ~       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  ~       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  ~
  ~       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  ~       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  ~       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
  ~       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
  ~       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  ~       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  ~       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  ~       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
  ~       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
  ~       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  ~       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  ~       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  ~       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  ~
  ~       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  ~       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  ~       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  ~
  ~    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  ~       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  ~       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  ~       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  ~       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  ~       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  ~
  ~    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  ~       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  ~       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  ~       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  ~       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  ~       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  ~       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  ~       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  ~       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  ~       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  ~       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  ~       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  ~       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  ~       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  ~       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  ~
  ~    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  ~       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  ~       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  ~       meet the following conditions:
  ~
  ~       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
  ~           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  ~
  ~       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  ~           stating that You changed the files; and
  ~
  ~       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  ~           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  ~           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  ~           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  ~           the Derivative Works; and
  ~
  ~       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  ~           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  ~           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  ~           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  ~           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  ~           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  ~           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  ~           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  ~           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  ~           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  ~           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  ~           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  ~           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  ~           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  ~           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  ~           as modifying the License.
  ~
  ~       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  ~       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  ~       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  ~       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  ~       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  ~       the conditions stated in this License.
  ~
  ~    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  ~       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  ~       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  ~       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  ~       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  ~       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  ~       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  ~
  ~    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  ~       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  ~       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  ~       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  ~
  ~    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  ~       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  ~       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  ~       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  ~       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  ~       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  ~       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  ~       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  ~       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  ~
  ~    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  ~       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  ~       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  ~       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  ~       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  ~       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  ~       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  ~       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  ~       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  ~       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  ~       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  ~
  ~    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  ~       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  ~       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  ~       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  ~       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  ~       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  ~       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  ~       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  ~       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  ~       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  ~
  ~    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  ~
  ~    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  ~
  ~       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
  ~       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
  ~       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
  ~       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
  ~       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
  ~       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
  ~       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
  ~       identification within third-party archives.
